                <p>I was born in North Carolina and grew up in a Military family. I've traveled all over the US and Europe. I want to write more and incorporate more traveling abroad into my life. I'm really big on building new relationships, making connections, and creating everlasting memories. I love challenges and treat every new unknown experience like an adventure.</p>

                <p><span>My passion:</span> I absolutely LOVE music - it's one of the most powerful and diverse methods for expression & communication. Since I love connecting with people I love sharing my love of music with others and finding new and less commercialized types of music. I mainly use streaming services to find new vibes. My goal is to attend a live concert and really get the full experience.</p>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p><span>A fun fact:</span> I played alot of video games growing up in a household with six kids. I remember watching my brothers play video games or I would start playing a game myself. Now as an adult I dont play any video games and my kids are shocked to see how good I am at every video game they play. I just tell them it's beginners luck and to keep practicing.</p>
